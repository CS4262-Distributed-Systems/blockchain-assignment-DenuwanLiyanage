<h1>About Blockchain</h1>

1. Block
    <p>Basic data structure of a blockchain is a block. It containes several data based on the blockchain. More typically it contains transactions. 
       If we have a node of the blockchain we will have a copy of the entireblock chain so we know every transactions happen on the blockchain. When
       searching for data on a blockchain system is going through these blocks.
</p>
     
2. Smart Contract
       <p>These are the programs run on the blockchain. In smart contract we can manipulate how the transactions should happen. 
        Every smart contracts should have some basic functions implemented which inherited from the blockchain. Apart from that, 
        the logic should be implemented by the owner of the smart contract. How functions and logics implement are depend on the blockchain.
        Anyone can create smart contracts and deploy.
  </p>
   
3. Test network
    <p>Almost every blockchain provide a test network. In here developers can create and deploy smart contract without spending original
      crypto currencies. Blockchains provides their faucet sites for developers to get some amount of crypto which used for gas fee in that blockchain. 
      Developers can get those crypto and spend those as gas fees on the test network only. Test network is for developers to check whether their smart contract 
      work properly.
